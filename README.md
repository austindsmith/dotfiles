# My Dotfiles

Really cool stuff. Dotfiles I basically just took from other repos and put into my computer. Very original. Really cool learning concepts personally.

Using this repo to also experiment with GitHub actions and stuff. Lot of learning going on considering we're just changing some colors on a screen no one but me sees.
