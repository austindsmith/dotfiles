# My Dotfiles

Really cool stuff. Dotfiles I basically just took from other repos and put into my computer. Very original. Really cool learning concepts personally.

## Neovim:

### Neo-tree

CTRL N -> Opens left panel directory view (neo-tree)
Shift Z -> Expands all folders in neo-tree
z -> Collapses all folders in neo-tree
Hides .git, but shows other hidden folders

### None-ls

This is to manage auto formatters.
