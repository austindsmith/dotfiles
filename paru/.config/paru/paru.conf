# PARU CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Paru is an AUR helper and pacman wrapper written in Rust
# Configuration options override defaults from /etc/paru.conf
# See: man paru.conf(5) for full documentation

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GENERAL OPTIONS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[options]

# PgpFetch: Automatically fetch PGP keys from keyservers when needed
# Prevents build failures due to missing keys
PgpFetch

# Devel: Check for development package updates (e.g., *-git packages)
# Checks the upstream source for new commits even if PKGBUILD version is unchanged
Devel

# Provides: Consider packages that provide dependencies, not just exact matches
# Allows alternative implementations (e.g., java-runtime-openjdk vs java-runtime)
Provides

# DevelSuffixes: Define which package name suffixes indicate development packages
# These packages will be checked for upstream updates when Devel is enabled
DevelSuffixes = -git -cvs -svn -bzr -darcs -always -hg -fossil

# BottomUp: Show AUR packages first, then repo packages during installation
# Makes it easier to review AUR packages that require more attention
BottomUp

# NewsOnUpgrade: Show Arch Linux news before performing system upgrades
# Important for staying informed about manual interventions required
NewsOnUpgrade

# CleanAfter: Remove build directory after package is built and installed
# Saves disk space by cleaning up temporary build files automatically
CleanAfter

# UpgradeMenu: Show a menu to select which packages to upgrade
# Useful for selectively upgrading packages or skipping problematic updates
#UpgradeMenu

# CombinedUpgrade: Resolve AUR and repo packages together in one transaction
# Default behavior, can be disabled if you prefer separate operations
#CombinedUpgrade

# RemoveMake: Remove makedepends after building packages
# Useful for keeping system clean, but may slow down subsequent builds
#RemoveMake

# SudoLoop: Periodically call sudo in the background to prevent timeout
# Useful for long builds to avoid having to re-enter password
#SudoLoop

# UseAsk: Use pacman's --ask flag for all operations
# Allows more interactive control over package operations
#UseAsk

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BINARY OPTIONS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Uncomment and modify these if you need custom tools or behavior

#[bin]
# FileManager: Specify which file manager to use for browsing packages
#FileManager = thunar

# MFlags: Additional makepkg flags to use when building packages
# Example: --skippgpcheck to skip PGP verification (not recommended)
#MFlags = --skippgpcheck

# Sudo: Use an alternative to sudo for privilege escalation
# Example: doas, pkexec
#Sudo = doas
